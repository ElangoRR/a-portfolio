  # Personal Portfolio Website UI

  This is a code bundle for Personal Portfolio Website UI. The original project is available at https://www.figma.com/design/VRAOCFzz9FogyAXcDDKYwu/Personal-Portfolio-Website-UI.

  ## Running the code

  1. Install dependencies: `npm install`

  2. Development server (recommended): `npm run dev` — opens the app at `http://localhost:3000` (Vite dev server).

  3. Static build (open in browser or serve with Live Server):
     - Run `npm run build` to create a static `build/` folder.
     - Open `build/index.html` directly in your browser (double-click) or serve `build/` using Live Server. The root `index.html` will redirect to the built static bundle when not running the Vite dev server.

  4. Preview a production build locally: `npm run preview` (serves the `build/` output on port 5000).
